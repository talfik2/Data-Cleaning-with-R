 Data-Cleaning-with-R
 In this repository, I cleaned NYPD Shooting Incident Data with R in this adress: "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
 
 This data covers the shooting incidents between 2006 - 2020.
 
 I used Tidyverse packages of R during the Data Cleaning.
